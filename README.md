Welcome to wayfare.


DESCRIPTION: This web application is for users to keep track of upcoming travel plans. Users may create trips and view other user's trips. 

TO GET STARTED: Run `bundle install` to get all of the necessary gems. To maximize the functionality of this web application, I highly recommend seeding with the provided data, or creating your own resort and state objects. On the frontend there is not a way to create/edit/delete resorts and states. Additionally, if you would like to start with some trips and user accounts already created - comment in the code below "Optional Faker Data" before you seed. Once the seeds.rb file is to your liking, run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` to create and seed the database. Have fun!
